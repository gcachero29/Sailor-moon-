<h2>My name is Gabrielle (for short Gabby) Cachero. I live in Skokie and I go to Niles west as a rising sophmore. I enjoy dressing up and  thrifting. I chose Code Evelate because my mom is pushing me to be a software engineer and I wanted to take the opportunity to join this program to see If I'd like to persue in this type of field in the future. I love how this program is open to creative freedom with our websites and how we got to travel around touring colleges. Over this summer, I think code elevate was one of my favorite things this summer</h2>\
