    <h2><strong>Usagi as a Character</strong></h2>
    <p>Usagi is shown as a normal teenage girl who loves to eat, hang around her friends, and who has abnormally horrible grades. 
        Usagi is a very playful character and she'll do anything for her friends. Outside of school, Usagi is secretly Sailor Moon, Tokyo's crime/monster fighter.</p>



        <h2>Description</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Long blonde hair usually styled in buns</li>
            <li>Big blue eyes</li>
            <li>Usually is spotted in her school uniform (Japanese middle school attire)</li>
        </ul>

            <h2><strong> Mamoru as a character</strong></h2>
            <p>Mamoru is actually such a bland character. He's not a good boyfriend either, he literally told Usagi that she needed to loose weight even though Usagi was so skinny and is at a healthy weight for her height. Outside from his normal life, 
                he is tuxedo mask who is just as bland as Mamoru. Tuxedo Mask barely does anything while sailor moon fights, he kinda just throws the tinnest rose ever and hope it kills the monster. I hate him Usagi deserves better. 
            </p>


    <h2>Description</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Has black hair basic kdrama styled</li>
        <li>black eyes</li>
        <li>often is wearing a green sweater with a black turtle neck and black pants</li>
        <li>Usagi's boyfriend</li>
        <li>grown man in university who is dating a middleschooler </li>
    </ul>

        <h2><strong>Chibi Usa as a Character</strong></h2>
        <p>Chibi Usa is just like her dad, bland but 100x worse. She makes a deal with the dark moon to become older so that she can date her dad. As weird as it sounds, she apparently couldn't recognize that Mamoru was her dad which does not make sense because her dad literally looks the same. The only difference between Mamoru in the past and future is that he used to have black hair and in the future he has white hair. Not only she tried to get with her dad "without knowing" in the process of this she almost killed the sailor scouts. I don't about usagi but if I were in her place and saw how much destruction this child has caused since Chibi Usa travels back in time, I'd make sure this menace isn't born</p>

 
        <h2>Description</h2>

    <h2>Rei as a character</h2>
    <p>Rei Hino is one of my favorite sailor scouts, she is a short tempered girl who has a fiery personality (just like her powers). She has amaculate style and she is an inspirational girl boss who will burn anyone who will get in her way.</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Long black hair wih wispy bangs</li>
            <li>Dark purple eyes</li>
            <li>Where's a lot of different clothes but mostly traditional japanese clothing</li>

    <h2> Motoki as a Character</h2>
    <p>In the first season Motoki was presented as Usagi's first crush in the series. Although I wouldn't like Usagi to end up with him (if it were to happen) He is still way better than Mamoru. I love his character because this man preaches body positivty in one episode in season 5, which mamoru could never.</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>

        <h2>Seiya as a Character</h2>
       <p> This woman is a absolutely a masterpeice made by the author. Seiya is BEST love interest for Usagi. When Usagi was lonely because Mamoru went to America for studies (but he was actually kidnapped, like in every other season because he's a wuss and can't do anything right smh), you know who was there? Seiya. Who comforted Usagi when she was sad because she thought Mamoru ghosted her? Seiya. Who didn't body shame her? Seiya. These are all valid points why Seiya was the better option. Also, Seiya is Sailor Scout for a different galaxy so she can literally obliberate Mamoru in a fight. <p>
 


        <ul>
            <li>Long black hair usually tied up in to a poney tail</li>
            <li>sometimes wearing sunglasses indoors</li>
            <li>Secretly a girl undercover as a guy</li>
            <li> athlete star at school</li>
            <li>is part of an all "boys" jpop group</li>
            <li>better than mamoru ofc</li>
        </ul>
