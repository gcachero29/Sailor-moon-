    <h2> About me! </h2>



    <h3>My name is Gabrielle (for short Gabby) Cachero. I live in Skokie and I go to Niles west as a rising sophmore. I enjoy dressing up and babysitting my nephew. I chose Code Evelate because my mom is pushing me to be a software engineer and I wanted to take the opportunity to join this program to see If I'd like to persue in this type of field in the future.</h2>\
