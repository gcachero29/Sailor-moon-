<h2>My name is Gabrielle (for short Gabby) Cachero. I live in Skokie and I go to Niles west as a rising sophmore. I enjoy dressing up and  thrifting. I chose Code Evelate because my mom is pushing me to be a software engineer and I wanted to take the opportunity to join this program to see If I'd like to persue in this type of field in the future. I love how this program is open to creative freedom with our websites and how we got to travel around touring colleges. Over this summer, I think code elevate was one of my favorite things this summer</h2>

<h4>Why I chose this theme</h1>
<h2>I chose this theme because I wanted to have fun with this project and make a little bit more personaly. I grew up with sailormoon and had enjoyed watching the after school in the 3rd grade on hulu.I also love the aesthetic of it so obviously I'd love to put in sailor moon's signiture colors which is yellow and pink.</h2>
