    <h2><strong>Usagi as a Character</strong></h2>
    <p>Usagi is shown as a normal teenage girl who loves to eat, hang around her friends, and who has abnormally horrible grades. 
        Usagi is a very playful character and she'll do anything for her friends. Outside of school, Usagi is secretly Sailor Moon, Tokyo's crime/monster fighter.</p>

            <h2><strong> Mamoru as a character</strong></h2>
            <p>Mamoru is actually such a bland character. He's not a good boyfriend either, he literally told Usagi that she needed to loose weight even though Usagi was so skinny and is at a healthy weight for her height. Outside from his normal life, 
                he is tuxedo mask who is just as bland as Mamoru. Tuxedo Mask barely does anything while sailor moon fights, he kinda just throws the tinnest rose ever and hope it kills the monster. I hate him Usagi deserves better.

        <h2><strong>Chibi Usa as a Character</strong></h2>
        <p>Chibi Usa is just like her dad, bland but 100x worse. She makes a deal with the dark moon to become older so that she can date her dad. As weird as it sounds, she apparently couldn't recognize that Mamoru was her dad which does not make sense because her dad literally looks the same. The only difference between Mamoru in the past and future is that he used to have black hair and in the future he has white hair. Not only she tried to get with her dad "without knowing" in the process of this she almost killed the sailor scouts. I don't about usagi but if I were in her place and saw how much destruction this child has caused since Chibi Usa travels back in time, I'd make sure this menace isn't born</p>

    <p>Rei Hino is one of my favorite sailor scouts, she is a short tempered girl who has a fiery personality (just like her powers). She has amaculate style and she is an inspirational girl boss who will burn anyone who will get in her way.</p>
